# Node.JS Server Farm
This is an Node.JS Server Farm made by me.
The project Node.JS version is v22.21.0.

## How to run?
Firstly, git clone the repo.
Secondly, npm install.
Threedly, npm run start.
That's it, and the servers gonna run on 0.0.0.0:6001, 0.0.0.0:6002, 0.0.0.0:6003.
Each server has it's index.html.
And also we have Dashboard to control the servers. It's running on 0.0.0.0:6004.
It's also mining... but not bitcoins. just numbers. idk how to explain that thing.
So that's it probably, you can fork and edit something.
Create a Issue if there's an bug.
